# Hydraulic Strcutures (Open Foam Simulation)

The following repository shows a simulation example with OpenFoam using the InterFoam solver for an open channel composed of a weir and a dissipation pool. 

The development is based on the use of the free software “SALOME” for the realization of the meshing of the structure and OpenFoam for the execution of the solver and the definition of the parameters for the simulation.

Finally, a small animation is generated to identify the flow behavior along the designed structure.
